If you enjoy what i am creating and feel want to help me keep doing it more better, feel free to consider making a donation, Every little bit would be a great helps, whether it's for improving the site, ensuring my domain keep active for next periode, expanding the contents to much more versatile types, or simply as a moral support for me to keep doing contents. Your donations will help me cover the cost of maintaining the site and ensure that it stay up without annoying ads :D

Below here are an option for you to show your support, and i appreciate anything that you're able to give:
